# agentic-rag
The Agentic RAG dynamically routes user queries to the most relevant sources‚Äîlocal documents, web search, or both‚Äîbased on the query context by providing transparency into the decision-making process to help users.

## üîç Features
- Context-aware query routing
- Integration with local document stores and web search
- Transparent decision-making logic
- Modular and extensible architecture

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Query Analysis**: Determines the nature of the user query.
2. **Source Selection**: Routes the query to:
   - Local documents
   - Web search
   - Or both, depending on context
3. **Response Generation**: Uses retrieved information to generate a coherent answer.
4. **Transparency Layer**: Explains why a particular source was chosen.
